Risk Analytics Dashboard | Early Warning Indicators for Credit Risk Management
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing a lending institution's customer risk profile using Early Warning Indicators (EWI), consolidating customer-level data across DPD, utilization, product type, income proof staleness, and region to proactively highlight operational and credit risks.
🎯 Key Metrics (150 Customers | ₹150M Portfolio):
Outstanding Balance: ₹110M | Average DPD: 30.9 days | High Risk Customers: 12% | High Utilization Accounts: 48 (ratio >1.0) | Exposure at Risk (EAR): ₹28M (25% of total exposure) | Stale Documentation: 19% (regulatory compliance risk)
📈 Risk Segmentation Insights:
By Region:

North & South contribute most high-risk accounts
South: High concern due to elevated DPD + high balances
East: Highest utilization (41.9%) but lowest high-risk % - early-stage stress indicator
North: 15% high-risk concentration despite fewer customers (32)

By Product:

Credit Cards & Personal Loans: Elevated high-risk clustering in North & West
Home Loans (North): Highest risk concentration
Auto Loans: High utilization yet lower defaults - strategic retention value
Credit Cards: High DPD across all regions → need revised limits

Temporal Trends:

Peak DPD: 42 in 2021 (post-pandemic stress)
30%+ improvement by 2023 → better collection efficiency/underwriting

💡 Critical Business Insights:

EAR Concentration Risk: North has 21% customers but 29% EAR - disproportionate exposure from high-ticket Home Loans
Product Strategy: Auto Loans show high utilization + low defaults = careful monitoring with retention focus
Leading Indicators: East region's 41.9% utilization with low risk% suggests proactive intervention needed before DPD spikes
Compliance Risk: 19% stale documents overlap with high-risk/high-utilization segments = audit flag
Recovery Performance: Post-2021 DPD decline demonstrates improved operational efficiency
